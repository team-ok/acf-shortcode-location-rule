# ACF Shortcode Location Rule
A WordPress Plugin that adds a new location rule to Advanced Custom Fields to make a field group appear on the post editing screen only when a certain shortcode is being used.

### Requirements
[Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)

### Features
* Use Advanced Custom Fields in conjunction with a certain shortcode, for example to provide data for your custom shortcode callback function instead of adding a long list of attributes to the shortcode itself.
* Choose from any registered shortcode tags.
